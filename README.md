# drvrej-spawner-exploit
Old Garry`s Mod exploit, patched in most RP servers, still may work on some.
Uses an unprotected net message to directly be able to spawn any NPC with any weapon equipped, including admin weapons, which are dropped on death.
Based on SynchronCity, but added a print for all weapons names in console for servers with blocked Q menu, as well as the ability to choose the NPC
and the weapon.

Script can be executed in any server, via lua_openscript_cl if enabled, or by any bypass such as external.
